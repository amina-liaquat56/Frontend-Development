## React Local Setup
1. download Nodejs and install
```
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

2. check if nodejs is installed? (open cmd and run the below command)
```
   node -v 
```

3. check if NPM is installed? (NPM-Node Package Manager)
```
   npm -v    
```
```
   
```
4.  go to the folder where you want to create project(d:/sanjay/react)& run the below command	
	npx create-react-app project1 (npx-node package executer)
	
```
                 
```
5. go to the created project folder(project1) and start your React application
```
   cd project1
```
```
   npm start 
```
```
  
```
6. A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! 
```
   open a browser tab and type 'http://localhost:3000/' if browser doesn't open automatically.
```
```
   set PORT=3001 && npm start

React Project with Typescript
=============================
-Create React App supports TypeScript out of the box.
-To create a new project with TypeScript support, run the below command
 npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
-To add TypeScript to an existing Create-React-App project, install the below things
 npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

 

create-react-app
================
-It is a React application boilerplate generator created by Facebook. 
-This CLI tool installs React,ReactDOM & other libraries required for a react project.
-It provides a development environment configured for ease-of-use with minimal setup.
-It creates a frontend build pipeline. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack.



NPX
===
-NPX : node package executer. 
-Its a Package runner/executer tool.
-It can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package.
 ex: npx create-react-app my-app
 

React app with Vite
===================
-Vite.js is a build tool and development server that is designed to optimize the development experience for modern web applications.
-It includes built-in support for TypeScript, CSS preprocessors.


1. Create a vite project
	npm create vite@latest
		(OR)
	npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react  
		(OR)
	npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
	
2. Go to the crated Project, install , and serve the application
	cd my-app
	npm install
	npm run dev
   
```
```
 
What React is
=============
-React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-It is an open-source, component based library. 
-It is created & maintained by Facebook.
-React is used to build single page applications.
-React allows us to create reusable UI components.
-ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill in data (views) in HTML DOM. 




React is NOT a framework
========================
-React is a library and not a framework.
-The difference between a library and a framework is that a library only helps 
 us in one aspect whereas a framework helps us in many aspects. 
Let's take an example:
-React is a library because it only takes care of our UI.
-Angular, on the other hand, is a framework because it handles much more than the UI 
 (It handles Dependency Injection, CSS encapsulation, httpClient, Form validation, routing etc.)


	Framework										Library
=========================================================================
-group of libraries to make your work easier	-performs specific, well-defined operations
-provides ready to use tools,standards			-provides reusable functions for our code
 templates for fast application development
-Collection of libraries & APIs					-collection of helper functions,objects
-cann't be easily replaceable 					-can be easily replaceable by another
-angular,vue									-jQuery,ReactJs,lodash,moment
-Hospital with full of doctors					-A doctor who specializes in one 		



		React						Angular
===========================================================
1. Library-2013					 1. Framework-2009
2. Light-weight					 2. Heavy
3. JSX + Javascript				 3. HTML + Typescript
4. Uni-Directional				 4. Two-way
5. Virtual DOM					 5. Regular DOM
6. Axios 				 		 6. HttpClientModule 
7. No 		 					 7. Dependency Injection
8. No							 8. Form Validation
9. extra libraries needed		 9. No additional libraries
10. UI heavy					 10. Functionality Heavy




React Features
==============
-Light weight
-JSX
-Components  (easy to build, easy to extend,reusable,loosly coupled)
-Oneway Data Binding (watchers will not be there for bindings)
-Virtual DOM
-Easy to learn because of its simple Design
-Performance




DOM (Document Object Model)
==========================
-DOM is a tree-like structure representing the HTML of a web page
-Allows JavaScript to interact with and modify the page's content, structure, and style.
