## React Local Setup
1. download Nodejs and install
```
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

2. check if nodejs is installed? (open cmd and run the below command)

   node -v 
```

3. check if NPM is installed? (NPM-Node Package Manager)
```
   npm -v    
```
```
   
```
4.  go to the folder where you want to create project(d:/sanjay/react)& run the below command	
	npx create-react-app project1 (npx-node package executer)
	
```
                 
```
5. go to the created project folder(project1) and start your React application
```
   cd project1
```
```
   npm start 
```
```
  
```
6. A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! 
```
   open a browser tab and type 'http://localhost:3000/' if browser doesn't open automatically.
